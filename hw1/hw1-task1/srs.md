Problem Statement: A few sentences to describe the problem you are trying to solve, i.e., justify why this software is needed.
With 60,000 new tracks being added to Spotify every day, online music streaming platforms are booming in popularity. The platform hosts 356 million active users that are becoming exposed to a large and growing catalogue of music and podcasts. The app will allow users to “like” tracks and create playlists, as there is no current way to systematically document the new music discovered and interests.  

Potential Clients: Who are influenced by this problem and would benefit from the proposed solution? (i.e. the potential users)
Potential clients would be users of Spotify (158 million premium users and 356 million monthly active users) that would like a more comprehensive method of cataloguing their listening activity and interests.

Proposed Solution: Write a few sentences that describe how a software solution will solve the problem described above.

The goal of this project is to create a plugin as a web application where we can observe and catalogue listening activity and interests. The app should improve the process of tracking and ranking songs and albums for users to better understand their own listening habits. Also, it should allow users to search among their own music catalogue using metadata such as artist, genre, tempo, and subject. 

Functional Requirements: List the (functional) requirements that software needs to have in order to solve the problem stated above. It is useful to try to group the requirements into those that are essential (must have), and those which are non-essential (but nice to have).

Must have
Requirements for the software are to connect to Spotify to get users’ recent listening activity and get Spotify metadata of songs and albums (artist, genre, tempo, subject, release year, etc). Another requirement is to allow users to rate each song, select favorite aspects of the music, and write descriptions so they can reflect on their own listening habits. The last requirement is to allow users to sort through saved songs by different metadata (most listened to, most recently listened to, genre, personal ranking, release date). 

Nice to have
Ideally, music recommendations will be built in using various aspects of metadata and user-rankings. 

Software Architecture
This app will use a client-server architecture as shown in the diagram:
