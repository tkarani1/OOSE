The Interface Segregation Principle has been violated. The classes BankPayment and LoanPayment which implement Payment are forced to implement methods that they donâ€™t use. BankPayment is forced to implement intiateLoanSettlement() and initiateRePayment(), and LoanPayment is forced to implement initiatePayments(), even though these operations are unsupported. Hence, code author is forced to throw an Exception, even though technically (according to the current definition of Payment), these methods exist in LoanPayment and BankPayment. This also violates the Liskov Substitution Principle, because BankPayment and LoanPayment are not fully substitutable for the parent Payment, since they are implementing methods that are unsupported. Lastly, the Single Responsibility Principle is violated because Payment is adding responsibilities (the three aforementioned methods) that are not in all Payment subclasses. 
In order to solve this problem, the methods initiatePayments(), intiateLoanSettlement(), and initiateRePayment()should be removed from Payment and be placed in their unique subclass. Only BankPayment should implemented initiatePayments(), and only LoanPayment should implement intiateLoanSettlement() and initiateRePayment().
